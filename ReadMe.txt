Dataset:
Data is extracted from Udacity Simulator. It has two different tracks, one is used
for collecting Training Data, other for Testing.
Training Data contains of frames saved from 3 different front-facing cameras 
in the simulator, from the car's point of view, as well as throttle, speed and
steering values for the vehicle.

We use the data extracted from the cameras over the course of 4 Training Laps 
to train our Model and expext it to predict the Steering Angles and drive the
vehicle without going off-road.
